      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Mandi and my pronouns are they/them. I'm in my 30s and learning how to code with the help of freeCodeCamp. Coding first interested me as a teenager when I would change HTML code in different MySpace custom profile themes. Since then, I've enjoyed gaming, reading, and photography as hobbies and pursued a career path in social services. However in 2022 I decided to transition career paths to that of software development with the goal of contributing to the efforts of accessible & user-friendly web-design. I would love to work with small businesses and nonprofits to make excellent websites that are convenient & fun to use!</p>
      <p id="bonus">In my spare time I still enjoy gaming, as well as gardening, cooking, yoga, reading, hiking, and spending time with my lovely spouse and our adorable dog Lola.</p>
