      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Max!
        Last year I began my coding journey with freeCodeCamp and more recently earned my 
        full-stack certification from Prime Digital Academy in July 2023.
        Coding first interested me as a teenager when I would change HTML
        in different MySpace custom profile themes. Since then, I've enjoyed gaming,
        reading, and photography as hobbies and pursued a career path in social services.
      </p>
      <p>
        However in 2022 I decided to transition career paths to that of software
        development with the goal of contributing to the efforts of accessible &
        user-friendly web-design. I would love to work with small businesses and
        nonprofits to make excellent websites that are convenient & fun to use;
        please <a class="contact-me" href="#contact-info">contact me</a> if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
      </p>
      <p id="bonus">In my spare time I still enjoy gaming, as well as yoga,
        cooking, reading, writing short stories, and walking around lakes with my lovely wife
        and our adorable dog Lola. I'm passionate about accessibility, love learning new things, 
        and find joy in reading & writing.
